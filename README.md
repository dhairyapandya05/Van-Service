# Zeep Service



## Description

Zeep Service is an ðŸ“± application used for students as well as students who commute from their homes to classes and vice versa. It is a travel management application where all drivers and customers are managed in the same place. Drivers can see who will be coming in the vehicle and who will not. This will enable them to get a clear picture of who they are and efficiently serve the students. Students can select their driver through subscriptions as well as per-day subscriptions. Students can cancel their rides right before they leave for the day. âœ…âœ…

Through the app, drivers can receive notifications regarding the total number of customers on the next trip as well as customers can accept or reject upcoming rides through notifications. Customers and drivers can register their complaints through the app's Whatsapp bot, which can be monitored by the support team in the near future. The data is represented through dashboards to get a clear idea of the users of the app.ðŸš—ðŸšŒ
In case of any crash app also has crashlytics which checks for any accidental errors if any and generates a full report of the crash that occurred in the app, the phone model that was used by the user during that crash, the time, and also exactly the line of the code in which the application got crashed. All the automation part is implemented by Quickwork which is Mumbai based automation company.ðŸš—ðŸšŒ
